# HotNets
## Tennis Data Visualization for Sportsbetters 

### Background
A 1-2 paragraph description of your project, providing the necessary context for someone unfamiliar with your project to understand what it does.

### Functionality & MVPs


Via HotNets, users will be able to:

* Compare players stats for live and upcoming tennis matches.
* View scores and stats for live games.
* Track betting odds during the day leading up to the match time and trends in odds during live match play.
* Sort live matches by "hotness," i.e. favorable risk opportunites.
* Visualize matches by point-to-point refreshed every 60 seconds.


### Wireframes
Draw the layout of your project: the major sections of the game view, the chart and its legend, the game controls and about me links, etc. This doesn't have to be a fully detailed mockup; it can just be labeled boxes showing the layout of your project. See the Sample Proposal for an example.

Wireframe.cc is a great tool for quickly creating wireframes.

### Technologies, Libraries, APIs
What technologies, libraries, and APIs will your project use? If you're building a game, you might use native browser technology like the Canvas API, or you might use a library like three.js. If you're doing data visualization, you might use d3 for rendering charts, and an API to fetch data.

If you're still deciding between a few different libraries or APIs, you can list the ones you're considering, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

If your project needs a backend (see below), list that here as well.
